# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Description

Bootstrap-Portfolio is all about introducing myself to everyone, what I do, and how to get in touch with me. This is another version of my portfolio. The difference is just that I used ordinaary CSS for the former while I used CSS popular framework(Bootstrap) for this one.

## Usage

Copy this link "https://hoduola5.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/" from the README, paste on the browser and navigate around the page. You can link up with me via the links on the footer section.

Here is the screenshot of what the form look like:
